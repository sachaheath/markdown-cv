## Currently

I am a Biodiversity Postdoctoral Fellow with the Living Earth Collaborative---with mentors at Saint Louis University, Washington University, and the Saint Louis Zoo. In collaboration with St. Louis Audubon's Bring Conservation Home program I am studying the effectiveness of residential native plant gardens in improving functional bird habitat along an urbanization gradient. 

### Research interests

Avian conservation and ecology, trophic interactions, agroecology, habitat selection, community ecology, conservation effectiveness.
